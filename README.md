## [Deployed Link](https://ed-form.netlify.app).

This project is a React application that utilizes several key dependencies. Here is a breakdown of the dependencies listed in the package.json file:

## @reduxjs/toolkit: This library provides a set of tools and abstractions for managing state in a React application using Redux. It simplifies the process of writing Redux logic, including actions, reducers, and store configuration.

## react: This is the core library for building user interfaces in React. It provides the fundamental functionality and component-based architecture for creating reusable UI components.

## react-dom: This library serves as the entry point for rendering React components in the browser. It includes methods for manipulating the DOM and rendering React elements into the specified container.

## react-redux: This library provides the bindings between React and Redux, enabling you to connect Redux state and actions to React components. It simplifies the integration of Redux into a React application.
 
## react-router-dom: This library offers declarative routing for React applications. It allows for navigation between different views or pages in a single-page application using a set of router components and hooks.

These dependencies indicate that the project is likely focused on building a React application with state management using Redux and routing using React Router. Redux provides a centralized state management solution, allowing for predictable and efficient handling of application data. React Router facilitates the navigation and routing between different pages or views within the application.
